Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client is DriverPass, liam the owner of DriverPass wants a website that can help soon to be drivers pass their to decrease the amount of fails. The type of system they wanted me to design was  a system that will allow customers to register for classes , make appointments for driving practice, and take driving tests. The system will be more accessible to customers making it more effective and efficient. The system will allow for customers to schedule, cancel, and reschedule their appointments online.

What did you do particularly well?
I feel that I made the diagrams pretty well by explaining the functions of the system clear.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 
I would probably go with the class diagrams, I would improve it by taking additional time to fully grasp the concept so that it may come out a little more concise.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
To interept the users neeeds would be to gather feedback during each development step. This allows you to have a grasp of what the users would actually want. Doing this saves time since it doesnt become a guessing game as to what the customers may find acceptable. Its important to take the users feedback into consideration since it will allow the system tobe recieved in a positive light since it contains features that the customers actually want.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
My approach would be more or less a step by step approach, using Object oriented programming since the object oriented Design is to inrease the productivity of the system and increasing the quality of the design. In the future to analyze and design system I would use the SDLC process, because having a clear plan for making and improve a particular piece of code or software quickly is imperative.
